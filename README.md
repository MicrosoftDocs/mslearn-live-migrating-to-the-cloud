# Microsoft Learn Live

Microsoft Learn Live is a series of instructor led courses designed to increase our learners' knowledge of Azure technologies.
As an extension of Microsoft Learn, Learn Live helps learners to connect multiple concepts to complete a real-world project.
Where a typical Learn module focuses on one specific job task, e.g. migrate your SQL database to Azure SQL, a Learn Live series will connect multiple job tasks to complete a full solution, e.g. migrate and secure a web based application to the cloud which includes migration of the database and the existing data.

## Series overview

Our first Learn Live series is titled "Migrate an ASP.NET Core application from an on-premises environment into Azure". We've created a scenario where we assume that you're a .NET developer working on an in-house system, and now it's time to make a move into the cloud. You work for a fictitious company called VanArsdel. VanArsdel is in the real estate business and they run a beautiful website where they're selling real estate property.
